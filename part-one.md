eCommerce Project - Part I
============================

[Part II](/part-two.md)

[Part III](/part-three.md)

##

### Objective

####

Build a backend using Node, Express, and MongoDB and connect it to a front-end Angular application

During this project, you will solidify your understanding of the MongoDB API.  You will also be able to see how the database fits into the bigger picture of a full application.


#####  Resources

* [MongoJS] (https://github.com/mafintosh/mongojs)
* [MongoDB Docs] (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/)


##### The Domain

Most companies sell some sort of product and service. For this project we will simulate building an eCommerce application.  We will build this project over the course of the next three days.

Today we are going to set up our Node application, set up a basic API, add functionality to do CRUD actions with products, and create a front-end interface to be able to create, read, update, and delete products.

### Set up Express app

####

Set up your Node app. For this project, use MongoJS to work with MongoDB. In this step, you'll need to:
1. Install the necessary npm packages (express, bodyParser, cors, mongojs)
2. Require the modules in your server.js file
3. Create your Express app (no endpoints yet) and listen for connections


### Initialize your connection to Mongo

####

This is new, but give it a try.  We already brought in mongojs.  Use it to create a new connection to the database

**TestPoint**: At the end of this step, you should be able to run your file with node and connect to MongoDB without any errors in your console.

####

When we require mongojs it gives us a function.  This function takes in two parameters:
* The name of the database we want to connect to
* An array of any collections we want to work with

Our database name is going to be `ecommerce` and we're only going to work with a `products` collection.

####

**code**
```
var db = mongo('ecommerce', ['products']);
```

### Create Express API

####

Now you'll create endpoints to create, read, update, and delete products (CRUD).  Have them each send back a unique random string on the `res`.

Here are the API endpoints we will need:

`POST /api/products`

`GET /api/products`
`GET /api/products/:id`

`PUT /api/products/:id`

`DELETE /api/products/:id`

**TESTPOINT**: You should be able to hit each of your endpoints without error and see any parameters or queries that you're sending along the way.  Check by using Postman by returning random strings in your endpoint handlers.

*Note*: We haven't hooked up to Mongo yet. This is just to test our Express API.

####

**Making an endpoint reminder**

A node endpoint is made by registering it with our express app :

`app.[method]([url], [callbackFunction])`

IE

`app.get('/orders/:id', function(req, res){})`

####

**code**
```
app.get('/api/products', function(req, res){
  res.send("I am a random string in GET api/products");
});

app.get('/api/products/:id', function(req, res){
  res.send("I will GET you a present at api/products. It is a " + req.params.id);
});

app.post('/api/products', function(req, res){
  res.send("Jellyfish live in POST api/products");
});

app.put('/api/products/:id', function(req, res){
  res.send("Once I was a walrus but then I was PUT in api/products with " + req.params.id);
});

app.delete('/api/products/:id', function(req, res){
   res.send("I have deleted nothing, especially not " + req.params.id)
});
```


### Add a product

####

Complete the POST `/api/products` endpoint

**TESTPOINT**: At this point you should be able to hit the endpoint and have it use your database. Use Postman to hit your endpoint.  You should be able to get a response back in Postman, and be able to see your data being added in your database.  You can check your database via the terminal or [MongoChef](http://3t.io/mongochef/).

####

**Mongo Query**

An new item query is in this format :
`db.[collectionName].save(newObj, function(err, response){})`

It's pretty standard to have the client to send us the item they want to save in the correct format.  To do this they use the body.
Pass the body into the query as the newObj.

(Hint: Body is accessed by calling `req.body` because we set up bodyParser earlier in our app.  If it's empty your error is probably an incorrect setup of bodyParser.)

The function will be invoked when our database call is done.  We want to check for errors and return a 500 status code if we got any.
If we have no err then return our result.  Just to make sure it's valid json use `res.json` and pass in our response.

####
**code**
```
app.post('/api/products', function(req, res){
	db.products.save(req.body, function(error, response){
		if(error) {
			return res.status(500).json(error);
		} else {
			return res.json(response);
		}
	});
});
```

### Get All Products

####

Now you'll connect your Express API to Mongo. After each query/action to Mongo is complete, we'll send a response back to the client.

Complete the GET /api/products endpoint

For each of these steps we're going to use our db object we made when we set up our connection to mongo.

**TESTPOINT**: At this point you should be able to hit the endpoint and have it touching your database. Use Postman to hit your endpoint.  You should be able to get a response back in Postman, and be able to see your data being returned from your database.  You can check your database via the terminal or [MongoChef](http://3t.io/mongochef/).

####


**Mongo Query**

A find multiple items query is in this format :
`db.[collectionName].find({}, function(err, response){})`

The empty object means we have no criteria. and we just want all the records in [collectionName].  

The function will be invoked when our database call is done.  We want to check for errors and return a 500 status code if we got any.
If we have no err then return our result.  Just to make sure it's valid json use `res.json` and pass in our response.

**Use req.query in our database query**
_req.query is also an object._ We can pass req.query into our `find()`.  This will let us change the query to mongo just by changing what we send to the endpoint.


##### Just the title

The following url : http://localhost:9001/api/products?title=shoe

Will give us this object on req.query
```
{
  title: "shoe"
}
```
So if we give this to mongo we are asking for any documents with a title equal to shoe


##### title and color

The following url : http://localhost:9001/api/products?title=shoe&color=red

Will give us this object on req.query
```
{
  title: "shoe",
  color: "red"
}
```
If we give this to mongo we are asking for any documents with a title equal to shoe and a color equal to red

####
**code**
```
app.get('/api/products', function(req, res){
	var query = req.query;
	db.products.find(query, function(err, response){
		if(err) {
			res.status(500).json(err);
		} else {
			res.json(response);
		}
	});
});

```

### Get One Product

####

Complete the GET `/api/products/:id` endpoint

**TESTPOINT**: At this point you should be able to hit the endpoint and have it use your database. Use Postman to hit your endpoint.  You should be able to get a response back in Postman, and be able to see your data returned from your database.  You can check your database via the terminal or [MongoChef](http://3t.io/mongochef/).

####

**Mongo Query**

A find multiple items query is in this format :
`db.[collectionName].findOne(queryObj, function(err, response){})`

We need to build a query object or we'll just get the first record.  This endpoint takes in an :id parameter.

We can build a query object that uses that id to query Mongo.

(Hint: mongo ids are not called id, but something very close)
(Hint2: mongo id values also need to be wrapped in mongo.ObjectId)
(Hint3: query parameters are accessed with `req.params.[parameterName]`)

The function will be invoked when our database call is done.  We want to check for errors and return a 500 status code if we got any.
If we have no err then return our result.  Just to make sure it's valid json use `res.json` and pass in our response.

####
**code**
```
app.get('/api/products/:id', function(req, res){
	var idObj = {
		_id: mongo.ObjectId(req.params.id)
	};
	db.products.findOne(idObj, function(err, response){
		if(err) {
			res.status(500).json(err);
		} else {
			res.json(response);
		}
	});
});

```

### Update a product

####

Complete the PUT `/api/products/:id` endpoint

**TESTPOINT**: At this point you should be able to hit the endpoint and have it use your database. Use Postman to hit your endpoint.  You should be able to get a response back in Postman, and be able to see your data being changed in your database.  You can check your database via the terminal or [MongoChef](http://3t.io/mongochef/).

####

**Mongo Query**

An update item query is in this format :
`db.[collectionName].update(queryObj, changesObj, function(err, response){})`

We need to build our queryObj.  We have our id from our parameters we just need to format it.
This is going to work exactly like it did in our `findOne()` above.
Pass the result in as the queryObj

It's pretty standard to have the client to send us a copy of item they want to save with the changes already made.  To do this they use the body.
Pass the body into the query as the changes.

The function will be invoked when our database call is done.  We want to check for errors and return a 500 status code if we got any.
If we have no err then return our result.  Just to make sure it's valid json use `res.json` and pass in our response.

####
**code**
```
app.put('/api/products/:id', function(req, res){
	if(!req.params.id){
		return res.status(400).send('id query needed');
	}
	var query = {
		_id: mongo.ObjectId(req.params.id)
	};
	db.products.update(query, req.body, function(error, response){
		if(error) {
			return res.status(500).json(error);
		} else {
			return res.json(response);
		}
	});
});
```

### Delete a product

####

Complete the DELETE `/api/products/:id` endpoint

**TESTPOINT**: At this point you should be able to hit the endpoint and have it use your database. Use Postman to hit your endpoint.  You should be able to get a response back in Postman, and be able to see your data being removed in your database.  You can check your database via the terminal or [MongoChef](http://3t.io/mongochef/).

####

**Mongo Query**

An delete item query is in this format :
`db.[collectionName].remove(queryObj, function(err, response){})`

The query object will delete all records matching the query.  If you send it an empty object it will delete everything.

In this case let's delete only a specific id.  Get the id from the req.params again just like in the update step and pass it in as our query object.
`_id` is guaranteed to be unique so by using that we can be sure to only delete the 1 record we want.

The function will be invoked when our database call is done.  We want to check for errors and return a 500 status code if we got any.
If we have no err then return our result.  Just to make sure it's valid json use `res.json` and pass in our response.

####
**code**
```
app.delete('/api/products/:id', function(req, res){
	if(!req.params.id){
		return res.status(400).send('id query needed');
	}
	var query = {
		_id: mongo.ObjectId(req.params.id)
	};
	db.products.remove(query, function(error, response){
		if(error) {
			return res.status(500).json(error);
		} else {
			return res.json(response);
		}
	});
});
```


### Create Front-end Interface

####

Now let's create the front-end. Feel free to set it up however you like.  The only stipulations are that you should have a main route/state where you can see all of the products and an admin route/state where you can create, edit, or delete products.  Don't worry about authentication or protecting your routes at this point.  If you have time, start to set up your front-end application as you think an eCommerce site should be organized.  Introduce some basic styling as well. You could use Bootstrap to help get things going visually.

**TestPoint**: At this point, you should be able to go to the main view and see all of the products that are in your database.  You should also be able to go to the admin view, where you can create, update, or delete products.  As you use this interface, you should be able to get responses from the server, and see the data being changed in the database.

### End Day 1

####

Congrats!  You've just created a skeleton eCommerce application.  Over the next couple of days we will be adding users and orders to our application to make it a full eCommmerce site.
