## Part I

### Objective

####

Build a backend using Node, Express, and MongoDB and connect it to a front-end Angular application

During this project, you will solidify your understanding of the MongoDB API.  You will also be able to see how the database fits into the bigger picture of a full application.


#####  Resources

* [MongoJS] (https://github.com/mafintosh/mongojs)
* [MongoDB Docs] (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/)


##### The Domain

Most companies sell some sort of product and service. For this project we will simulate building an eCommerce application.  We will build this project over the course of the next three days.

Today we are going to set up our Node application, set up a basic API, add functionality to do CRUD actions with products, and create a front-end interface to be able to create, read, update, and delete products.

### Set up Express app

####

Set up your Node app. For this project, use MongoJS to work with MongoDB. In this step, you'll need to:
1. Install the necessary npm packages (express, body-parser, cors, mongojs)
2. Require the modules in your server.js file
3. Create your Express app (no endpoints yet) and listen for connections


### Initialize your connection to Mongo

####

This is new, but give it a try.  We already brought in mongojs.  Use it to create a new connection to the database

**TestPoint**: At the end of this step, you should be able to run your file with node and connect to MongoDB without any errors in your console.

####

When we require mongojs it gives us a function.  This function takes in two parameters:
* The name of the database we want to connect to
* An array of any collections we want to work with

Our database name is going to be `ecommerce` and we're only going to work with a `products` collection.

####

**code**
```
var db = mongo('ecommerce', ['products']);
```

### Create Express API

####

Now you'll create endpoints to create, read, update, and delete products (CRUD).  Have them each send back a unique random string on the `res`.

Here are the API endpoints we will need:

`POST /api/products`

`GET /api/products`
`GET /api/products/:id`

`PUT /api/products/:id`

`DELETE /api/products/:id`

**TESTPOINT**: You should be able to hit each of your endpoints without error and see any parameters or queries that you're sending along the way.  Check by using Postman by returning random strings in your endpoint handlers.

*Note*: We haven't hooked up to Mongo yet. This is just to test our Express API.

####

**Making an endpoint reminder**

A node endpoint is made by registering it with our express app :

`app.[method]([url], [callbackFunction])`

IE

`app.get('/orders/:id', function(req, res){})`

####

**code**
```
app.get('/api/products', function(req, res){
  res.send("I am a random string in GET api/products");
});

app.get('/api/products/:id', function(req, res){
  res.send("I will GET you a present at api/products. It is a " + req.params.id);
});

app.post('/api/products', function(req, res){
  res.send("Jellyfish live in POST api/products");
});

app.put('/api/products/:id', function(req, res){
  res.send("Once I was a walrus but then I was PUT in api/products with " + req.params.id);
});

app.delete('/api/products/:id', function(req, res){
   res.send("I have deleted nothing, especially not " + req.params.id)
});
```


### Add a product

####

Complete the POST `/api/products` endpoint

**TESTPOINT**: At this point you should be able to hit the endpoint and have it use your database. Use Postman to hit your endpoint.  You should be able to get a response back in Postman, and be able to see your data being added in your database.  You can check your database via the terminal or [MongoChef](http://3t.io/mongochef/).

####

**Mongo Query**

An new item query is in this format :
`db.[collectionName].save(newObj, function(err, response){})`

It's pretty standard to have the client to send us the item they want to save in the correct format.  To do this they use the body.
Pass the body into the query as the newObj.

(Hint: Body is accessed by calling `req.body` because we set up bodyParser earlier in our app.  If it's empty your error is probably an incorrect setup of bodyParser.)

The function will be invoked when our database call is done.  We want to check for errors and return a 500 status code if we got any.
If we have no err then return our result.  Just to make sure it's valid json use `res.json` and pass in our response.

####
**code**
```
app.post('/api/products', function(req, res){
	db.products.save(req.body, function(error, response){
		if(error) {
			return res.status(500).json(error);
		} else {
			return res.json(response);
		}
	});
});
```

### Get All Products

####

Now you'll connect your Express API to Mongo. After each query/action to Mongo is complete, we'll send a response back to the client.

Complete the GET /api/products endpoint

For each of these steps we're going to use our db object we made when we set up our connection to mongo.

**TESTPOINT**: At this point you should be able to hit the endpoint and have it touching your database. Use Postman to hit your endpoint.  You should be able to get a response back in Postman, and be able to see your data being returned from your database.  You can check your database via the terminal or [MongoChef](http://3t.io/mongochef/).

####


**Mongo Query**

A find multiple items query is in this format :
`db.[collectionName].find({}, function(err, response){})`

The empty object means we have no criteria. and we just want all the records in [collectionName].  

The function will be invoked when our database call is done.  We want to check for errors and return a 500 status code if we got any.
If we have no err then return our result.  Just to make sure it's valid json use `res.json` and pass in our response.

**Use req.query in our database query**
_req.query is also an object._ We can pass req.query into our `find()`.  This will let us change the query to mongo just by changing what we send to the endpoint.


##### Just the title

The following url : http://localhost:9001/api/products?title=shoe

Will give us this object on req.query
```
{
  title: "shoe"
}
```
So if we give this to mongo we are asking for any documents with a title equal to shoe


##### title and color

The following url : http://localhost:9001/api/products?title=shoe&color=red

Will give us this object on req.query
```
{
  title: "shoe",
  color: "red"
}
```
If we give this to mongo we are asking for any documents with a title equal to shoe and a color equal to red

####
**code**
```
app.get('/api/products', function(req, res){
	var query = req.query;
	db.products.find(query, function(err, response){
		if(err) {
			res.status(500).json(err);
		} else {
			res.json(response);
		}
	});
});

```

### Get One Product

####

Complete the GET `/api/products/:id` endpoint

**TESTPOINT**: At this point you should be able to hit the endpoint and have it use your database. Use Postman to hit your endpoint.  You should be able to get a response back in Postman, and be able to see your data returned from your database.  You can check your database via the terminal or [MongoChef](http://3t.io/mongochef/).

####

**Mongo Query**

A find multiple items query is in this format :
`db.[collectionName].findOne(queryObj, function(err, response){})`

We need to build a query object or we'll just get the first record.  This endpoint takes in an :id parameter.

We can build a query object that uses that id to query Mongo.

(Hint: mongo ids are not called id, but something very close)
(Hint2: mongo id values also need to be wrapped in mongo.ObjectId)
(Hint3: query parameters are accessed with `req.params.[parameterName]`)

The function will be invoked when our database call is done.  We want to check for errors and return a 500 status code if we got any.
If we have no err then return our result.  Just to make sure it's valid json use `res.json` and pass in our response.

####
**code**
```
app.get('/api/products/:id', function(req, res){
	var idObj = {
		_id: req.params.id
	};
	db.products.findOne(idObj, function(err, response){
		if(err) {
			res.status(500).json(err);
		} else {
			res.json(response);
		}
	});
});

```

### Update a product

####

Complete the PUT `/api/products/:id` endpoint

**TESTPOINT**: At this point you should be able to hit the endpoint and have it use your database. Use Postman to hit your endpoint.  You should be able to get a response back in Postman, and be able to see your data being changed in your database.  You can check your database via the terminal or [MongoChef](http://3t.io/mongochef/).

####

**Mongo Query**

An update item query is in this format :
`db.[collectionName].update(queryObj, changesObj, function(err, response){})`

We need to build our queryObj.  We have our id from our parameters we just need to format it.
This is going to work exactly like it did in our `findOne()` above.
Pass the result in as the queryObj

It's pretty standard to have the client to send us a copy of item they want to save with the changes already made.  To do this they use the body.
Pass the body into the query as the changes.

The function will be invoked when our database call is done.  We want to check for errors and return a 500 status code if we got any.
If we have no err then return our result.  Just to make sure it's valid json use `res.json` and pass in our response.

####
**code**
```
app.put('/api/products/:id', function(req, res){
	if(!req.params.id){
		return res.status(400).send('id query needed');
	}
	var query = {
		_id: mongo.ObjectId(req.params.id)
	};
	db.products.update(query, req.body, function(error, response){
		if(error) {
			return res.status(500).json(error);
		} else {
			return res.json(response);
		}
	});
});
```

### Delete a product

####

Complete the DELETE `/api/products/:id` endpoint

**TESTPOINT**: At this point you should be able to hit the endpoint and have it use your database. Use Postman to hit your endpoint.  You should be able to get a response back in Postman, and be able to see your data being removed in your database.  You can check your database via the terminal or [MongoChef](http://3t.io/mongochef/).

####

**Mongo Query**

An delete item query is in this format :
`db.[collectionName].remove(queryObj, function(err, response){})`

The query object will delete all records matching the query.  If you send it an empty object it will delete everything.

In this case let's delete only a specific id.  Get the id from the req.params again just like in the update step and pass it in as our query object.
`_id` is guaranteed to be unique so by using that we can be sure to only delete the 1 record we want.

The function will be invoked when our database call is done.  We want to check for errors and return a 500 status code if we got any.
If we have no err then return our result.  Just to make sure it's valid json use `res.json` and pass in our response.

####
**code**
```
app.delete('/api/products/:id', function(req, res){
	if(!req.params.id){
		return res.status(400).send('id query needed');
	}
	var query = {
		_id: mongo.ObjectId(req.params.id)
	};
	db.products.remove(query, function(error, response){
		if(error) {
			return res.status(500).json(error);
		} else {
			return res.json(response);
		}
	});
});
```


### Create Front-end Interface

####

Now let's create the front-end. Feel free to set it up however you like.  The only stipulations are that you should have a main route/state where you can see all of the products and an admin route/state where you can create, edit, or delete products.  Don't worry about authentication or protecting your routes at this point.  If you have time, start to set up your front-end application as you think an eCommerce site should be organized.  Introduce some basic styling as well. You could use Bootstrap to help get things going visually.

**TestPoint**: At this point, you should be able to go to the main view and see all of the products that are in your database.  You should also be able to go to the admin view, where you can create, update, or delete products.  As you use this interface, you should be able to get responses from the server, and see the data being changed in the database.

### End Day 1

####

Congrats!  You've just created a skeleton eCommerce application.  Over the next couple of days we will be adding users and orders to our application to make it a full eCommmerce site.

## Part II

### Objectives

####

Build a backend using Node, Express, and MongoDB and connect it to a front-end Angular application.

During this project you will practice using an ORM (Mongoose) to work with your database.  You will also solidify your understanding of models, schemas, middleware, and indexing.

##### Resources
* [Mongoose] (http://mongoosejs.com/)

##### The Domain

We'll continue building the eCommerce application.

Today you are going to convert the current Mongo functionality to use Mongoose.  You will be creating a Product model and replacing the current product functionality with that model.

### Set up Mongoose

####

At your application's root folder, run the following command via command line: `npm uninstall --save mongojs`.  This will remove mongojs from your node_modules folder and from your package.json.  Remove or comment out any logic related to MongoJS.

After removing everything MongoJS related, you should be able to start up your server and run it without any errors.

Now that MongoJS is removed, install Mongoose and follow the [instructions](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html) to connect to MongoDB.  In your code, connect to Mongo after your Express app has started listening.  

**TestPoint**: After setting up Mongoose, you should be able to listen with your Express app and with Mongoose.  The Mongoose connection method can optionally take a callback as the last argument.  That callback sends one argument, `error`.  `console.log` the `error` parameter.  If it's undefined, you've connected correctly. See [this SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6676499/is-there-a-mongoose-connect-error-callback) answer for an example.

####

**Mongoose connection**
```
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/products');
```


### Step 2: Create Product Model

####

Remove or comment out the logic from your endopints that handle creating, reading, updating, and deleting products.  You are going to create a Mongoose Product model and do your CRUD actions that way.

Create a new Product schema and model.  Give it the following fields:

 - **Title**: This will be the title of the product
  - String
  - Unique
  - Required
  - Index
 - **Description**: This will describe your product
  - String
  - Required
 - **Price**: This will be the price of your product
  - Number
  - Required
  - Minimum of 0

Feel free to add any additional fields you feel are necessary.

####

A lot of this is things we learned in node.
* Create a new file
* require mongooose
* create your schema
* export a model built from a schema

**Creating a schema**

To create a schema we invoke `mongoose.Schema()` function and pass in an object with the fields we want.
To define a type we set the value equal to an object.

This creates a schema with one property, name, that is a required and unique string.
```
mongoose.Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true, unique: true}
})
```

**Creating a model**
Once we've built our schema object we want to save it to a variable so that we can make a model with it.
That structure looks like this:

`mongoose.model('[collectionName]', schemaObj)`

We want to export this model.

####
**Code**
```
var mongoose = require('mongoose')
  , Schema   = mongoose.Schema

var schema = new Schema({
  title       : {type: String, unique: true, required: true, index: true}
, description : {type: String, required: true}
, price       : {type: Number, required: true, min: 0}
})

module.exports = mongoose.model('product', schema)

```


### Update our queries to use mongoose

####

Now go to each of your product endpoints and put the necessary Mongoose logic to [Create](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.create), [Read](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.find), [findById](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.findById),  [Update](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.findByIdAndUpdate) and [Delete](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.findByIdAndRemove) products. Refer to those links for documentation.

**TestPoint**: At this point you should be able to manipulate the product data via your Express endpoints just like you could when MongoJS was installed.  Test this using POSTMan and the command line or RoboMongo.  After you test the endpoints, go to your front-end product interface (if you were able to build it yesterday) and make sure that the interface still works and manipulates the data like you expect. You may have to update your data models on the front-end to match the model we just set up with Mongoose.

The next step will integrate your backend to the front-end application that you built yesterday.  You will also expand the application to include new functionality.

####

Mongoose queries work almost identically to mongo queries.  The differences:
* Instead of using the db object from a connection we just make a 'model' and use the model directly.
* Some of the terms are slightly different.

That's about it.  Callbacks, object structure, queries, all work pretty much the same.

**General flow**

* Require your model at the top of the file you want to use it in and save it to a variable.
* Use the model to do the query you want
* Send a response back to the user

####

**Updated queries**

##### Find many query
```
Product.find(req.query, function(err, response){
    if(err) {
      res.status(500).json(err)
    } else {
      res.json(response)
    }
  })
```

##### Find one query
```
Product.findById(req.params.id, function(err, response){
    if(err) {
      res.status(500).json(err)
    } else {
      res.json(response)
    }
  })
```

##### post query
```
Product.create(req.body, function(error, response){
   if(error) {
     return res.status(500).json(error)
   } else {
     return res.json(response)
   }
 })
```

##### update query
```
Product.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, function(error, response){
  if(error) {
    return res.status(500).json(error)
  } else {
    return res.json(response)
  }
});
```

##### update query
```
Product.findByIdAndRemove(req.params.id, function(error, response){
  if(error) {
    return res.status(500).json(error)
  } else {
    return res.json(response)
  }
})
```


### Cleaning up our code

####

It is important to keep your code looking clean and neat.  It would be wise for you to outsource the logic from each of your endpoints to a product controller or something similar.  You should also outsource your schema and model declarations to a Product model file.  If you need reminders on how Node's require and export system works, check out [this](http://openmymind.net/2012/2/3/Node-Require-and-Exports/) blog post.

### Connect Front-End

####

Endpoints are how a front end and back end communicate.  Urls, parameters, queries, and bodies.  That's it.  We didn't change any of those today.  We only changed what was going on underneath.  So our front end should still work!

Make sure that you have an interface where users can view products and add them to their cart.  

**TestPoint**: You should now be able to see all of the products on the front-end.

Once you've finished the front-end, take some time to style your app and make it user-friendly.  Tomorrow you will finish the app by adding a a cart to the user, allow them to check out, and keep track of their current and past orders.

## Part III

### Objective

####

Build a backend using Node, Express, and MongoDB and connect it to a front-end Angular application.

During this project you will use Mongoose to create relationships between multiple sets of data.

##### Resources
* [Mongoose] (http://mongoosejs.com/)

##### The Domain

Today you are going to create two new schemas, one for Orders and one for Carts.  You are also going to create a relationship between Carts and Products using a reference, a relationship between Orders and Products using embedding, and a relationship between Orders and Users using reference.

### Create The order schema

####

Create a schema for orders.  Add whatever fields you feel it might need.  

*Orders should have two special relationships: a reference to a user, and embedded products.*

Create the Order model with your schema and export it.

####

**Refs**

Refs on an object schema are made by specifying the type as `Schema.Types.ObjectId`, AND adding a `ref: [modelName]` key on that same schema.

IE - If I have a Pet with a reference to an Owner it would look like this:

```
var petSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    owner: {type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Owner'}
})
```

**Embedded Schema**

Embedded Schema is made by specifying the type as a pre-made Schema object.   

IE - If I have an owner with multiple pets:

* Make a pet schema
* Make an owner schema
* In the owner schema add an array of pets
  * The array of pets should be of type petSchema

This would look like this on the owner side

```
var petSchema = require('./petSchema');

var owner = new mongoose.Schema({
  pets: [{type: petSchema}]
})
```

**Notes on sharing schema**
Shared schema doesn't have to be in another file, but it's usually cleaner.

If I do put it in another file I need to export the schema object.  I would NOT make a mongoose.model using the schema.

####

__Code__
```
var mongoose = require('mongoose')
  , Schema   = mongoose.Schema

var schema = new Schema({
  user     : {type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true}
, products : [{
    item     : productSchema
  , quantity : {type: Number, required: true, min 1}
  }]
, ordered : {type: Date, default: new Date()}
})

module.exports = mongoose.model('orders', schema)
```


### Create The cart schema
Create a schema for carts.  Add whatever fields you feel it might need.  

*Carts should have an array of references to products.*

Once you've created your schema, export it (NOT as a model).  Then go to your User model and use the cart schema for the User's cart field.

*Note*:  This may seem confusing.  Technically, you could just define the new fields in the User's schema.  But it's important to know that a schema is just a pattern or blueprint to follow.  It can be used in multiple models.  For clarification on the difference between a schema and a model see [this SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22950282/schema-vs-model).

**TestPoint**: You should be able to spin up your server without any errors.  You should also be able to test that your new Order model and new cart schema are working.  You can either create a dummy endpoint and hook it up to your models, or write a script in your server.js file and run it on server load.  Test and make sure that you can create new Orders and add items to a user's cart.

If you've passed this TestPoint, then you have essentially set up your relationships.  Good work!  Let's walk through how you are going to work with these relationships.

####

We're using an embedded schema just like in the prior step.

####
__cartSchema.js__
```
var mongoose = require('mongoose')
  , Schema   = mongoose.Schema

var schema = new Schema({
  products : [{
    item     : {type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'product', required: true}
  , quantity : {type: Number, min: 1}
  }]
})

module.exports = schema;
```

__userModel.js__
```
var mongoose = require('mongoose')
  , cart     = require('./cart')

var schema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name     : {type: String, required: true}
,	email    : {type: String, required: true, unique: true, index: true}
, password : {type: String, required: true}
, cart     : [cart]
, orders   : []
})

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', schema)
```

### Create Endpoints

####

Create the following Express endpoints:
 * **POST** `/api/user/`
 * **POST** `/api/order/:user_id`
 * **GET** `/api/order/`
 * **POST** `/api/cart/:user_id`
 * **PUT** `/api/cart/:user_id`
 * **GET** `/api/user/:id`

### Cart POST

####

With the cart POST endpoint, you will expect a request parameter of `user_id` that will be the id of a user. The request body will have a JSON of the product that is being added to the cart, including a quantity.  
We have the id of the user we want to update, and the item we want to add to the cart.
Use findByIdAndUpdate with [$push](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update/push/) to add your item to the cart

*Note*: At some point you may realize that the models you created earlier are not complete enough for what we're trying to do.  Feel free to go back and change your models to make them work.

####

__$push__
$push is a way to tell mongo to 'push' the value into an array instead of overriding an existing array.  
If I had an owner with an array of pets I would write something like this to add a new pet

```
Owner.findByIdAndUpdate([userId], {$push: {pets: newPetObj}})
```

This is going to find the user with the id we pass it, then `push` into the `pets` property a value of whatever is on our `newPetObj`

####
__code__  

```
User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.user_id, {$push: {cart: req.body}}, function(err, res){
      //handle the response here by checking for err etc.  Just like existing handlers.
  })
```

### Cart PUT

####

The cart PUT endpoint will be similar, but is intended to change the quantity of a particular item in the cart. If the new quantity is 0, simply remove the item from the cart altogether. We should get two properties on our req.query , a qty and itmId

####

There isn't a one operation way to update the data while it's in the collection.  

The url we'll use to hit this endpoint will look like this :

`/api/cart/:user_id?qty=value&itmId=value`

`http://localhost:9001/api/cart/abd3a-hoibzxcli-23bklasdv-asef/?qty=3&itmId=hoinbs-aw43lnvas-aslisd-alnxcibo`




That gives us the user id, id of the item we want to update, and the qty we want to update.

Use the user id to get the user out.
Once you have the user find the item in the cart with the matching id and update the quantity.  
If the new quantity is 0 remove it instead.

Save the entire user back to the database.

####
__code__
```
User.findById(req.params.user_id, function(err, resp) {
     if (err) {
       res.status(500).send(err)
     }
     var myUser = resp;
     var qty = req.query.qty / 1;
     var foundItem = -1;
     myUser.cart.forEach(function(cartItem, index) {
       if (cartItem._id.toString() === req.query.itmId) {
         foundItem = index
       }
     })
     if (foundItem >= 0) {
        console.log("Found Item = " + foundItem)
       if (qty === 0) {
         myUser.cart.splice(foundItem, 1);
       } else {
         myUser.cart[foundItem].qty = qty
       }
     }
     saveUser(myUser, req, res);
   })
   function saveUser(userToSave, req, res) {
     userToSave.save(function(err, result) {
       if (err) {
         res.status(500).send(err)
       } else {
         res.send(result)
       }
     })
   };
}
```

### User GET

####

We need to send the entire cart whenever the user is retrieved.  Look at Mongoose's [.populate()](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html) method.  Wherever you are getting your user, add the .populate to populate your cart before sending it to the client.

####

To get populate to work we want to use their 'exec' syntax.  When writing the query this way we pass the pieces in to small chained functions, and then when we're all done we call exec.

IE - Let's assume we have an owner with pets.  The pets array has a `ref` to another collection called `breeds`.  A piece of data might look like this:
```
{
  firstName: 'Johno',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  pets: [
    {
      breed: 'asdf-adf-gbaewg-asd-se',
      name: 'sparky'
    },
    {
      breed: 'dgasd-agasdg-uyjk-fbe',
      name: 'donut'
    }
  ]
}

```

The breed isn't a real breed!  Because it's a ref all we have is an id. That id matches a document in our breeds collection.  
When using populate we're telling mongo replace that id with the entire document from the breeds collection.  
That query looks something looks something like this.

```
Owner
  .findOne({lastName: 'Smith'})
  .populate('pets/breed')
  .exec(function(err, owner){

})
```


####
```
User
  .findById(req.params.user_id)
  .populate('cart/product')
  .exec()
  .then(function(results){
    //Yay it worked, return it
  }, function(err){
    //Uh oh, problemo.  Return a 500 status and the error.
  })

})
```

### Order POST

####

With the order POST endpoint, send a request param of `user_id` that will include the id a user.  In the handler, get the user's cart and create a new order with the products in the cart.  Make sure you use the user's id to reference from the order to the user. After successfully creating the order, empty the user's cart.

There isn't anything new that we haven't done here so give it a try.

**TestPoint**:  Create a new user and add several items to their cart.  Then take their id and hit the `/api/order` endpoint with it (via Postman or your Angular application).  It should create a a new order and empty the user's cart.  Use MongoChef or the command line to check the data.

####

Here is the flow with some hints:
__PseudoCode__
```
userId = req.params.user_id
User.findById
  //Handle errors
  user = result
  newOrder = buildOrder(user)
  newOrder.save
    //Handle Errors
    user.cart = []
    user.orders.push( ObjectId(newOrder.id))
    user.save
      //Handle Errors
      //return success result
```

####
__code__

```
create: function(req, res) {
  var userId = req.params.userId;
  User.findById(userId, function(err, result) {
    if (err) {
      res.sendStatus(500);
    }
    var userObj = result;
    var userOrder = {};
    userOrder.products = userObj.cart;
    userOrder.userId = userId;
    var newOrder = new Order(userOrder);
    newOrder.save(function(err, result) {
      if (err) {
        res.sendStatus(500);
      }
      userObj.cart = [];
      userObj.orders.push(mongoose.Types.ObjectId(result._id));
      // userObj.update({$push: {orders: mongoose.Types.ObjectId(result._id)}},
      userObj.save(function(err, result) {
        if (err) {
          res.sendStatus(500);
        }
        res.send(result);
      });
    });
  });
}
```


### Order GET

####

With the order GET endpoint, simply accept a reqeust query of whatever orders you're searching for.  For example, if you were looking for all orders placed on a certain day, the URL might look like this: `/api/order?date=07/09/16`.  If you were looking for a specific user's orders, it might look like so: `/api/order?user=o09f6d8fnn7df7n9joj`.  Look at Mongoose's [query](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html) documentation if you need some examples.

**TestPoint**: You should be able to test your order GET endpoint via Postman or your app.  Try a few different queries.  The most important one is the user query.

If you've passed this last breakpoint, then  you've finished the backend of your application. Well done.

####

If you looked at this you're over thinking the problem.  

Take the req.query and pass it into a mongo query on the orders table as the criteria.  
Return the results!

####

__code__

```
Order.find(req.query, function(err, result) {
      if (err) {
        res.sendStatus(500);
      }
      res.send(result);
    });
```

### Connect front-end

####

Take some time to connect your Express API to your Angular application.  You have a lot of freedom in how you do that.  Make sure that you have the ability to add items to a user's cart (you might create a dropdown menu to select a user, since there is no authentication yet), view the cart, create a new order, and view that order.  If you finish that with ample time, add some extra styling and/or functionality.

**Breakpoint**: You should be able to add items to a user's cart, view the cart, create and view orders.

If you pass that breakpoint, then congrats!  You've just built your first full-stack application!  What you've just done is the basics of building any CRUD app.
