eCommerce Project
=================


### Objective



####

Build a backend using Node, Express, Massive, and SQL and connect it to a front-end Angular application

During this project, you will solidify your understanding of the Massive API.  You will also be able to see how the database fits into the bigger picture of a full application. 

Most companies sell some sort of product and service. For this project we will simulate building an eCommerce application.  We will build this project over the course of the next three weeks. 
This could be a portfolio piece going forward if you work hard and make this a well designed app.
*Note: The basic requirements of this project are not enough for a portfolio piece. If you are looking to make this a portfolio piece, push yourself above and beyond the basic requirements.*

There are two objectives for this project:

1. Create a full stack app.

2. Solidify all the concepts you have learned so far.


#### Requirements

- Use the full stack (SQL, Node, Express, Massive, and Angular)
- Use a foreign key reference
- Implement a products table
- Implement a cart system
  - Add to cart
  - Remove from cart
  - "Checkout" from cart: Remove all items, give the user the total they should "pay".

*Note: This should simulate an ecommerce online store. It is not necessary to actually implement paying money.*

Outside of these requirements, feel free to add additional features. Some ideas:

- Use auth and allow the user to log in.
- Use a third party API.
- Make your website responsive (mobile-friendly).
- Use ES6.
- Implement a build tool, such as Gulp.
- Use SASS instead of CSS.
- Host your project online.
- Use mock transactions with Stripe.
- Use unit tests to automatically test your endpoints.
